This file contains a collection of scripts to automatically build and install packages from the BLFS 7.9 book.

A standard script directory contains the following scripts:
setting.script
build.script
check.script (if a test suit exists)
porg.script
install.script

Results are logged to
install.log (for the complete installation run by the master script "install.script" in this folder)
check.log (if a test suit is run)

Some directories which have different scripts as install.script are:

* the one where the test are done after installing
xorg_build_environment
xorg_protocol_headers
